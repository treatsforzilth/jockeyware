<h1>Jockeyware</h1>
<p>this is a mod of a decomp of the rensenware ransomware. it makes you watch the minecraft movie to decrypt your files.</p>
<h3>changes to the original code:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>no winforms, this runs entirely from cmd.</li>
  <li>doesn't check for ram addresses, trusts that the user is watching minecraft with a timer.</li>
  <li>runs from a single source file and class.</li>
</ul>
<p>i won't distribute any compiled code because it might get me into trouble if this wrecks any actual computers. for the love of god only run malware on virtual machines.<br>
if you want to compile this... idk i compiled with the latest (6.12.0) mono version and ran everything .net 4.0 on windows 7. if you know how make it work on your own machine then do it but that was my dev environment.</p>
